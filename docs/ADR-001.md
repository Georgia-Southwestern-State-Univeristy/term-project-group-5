ADR-001: Database Selection — MongoDB Over Firebase 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Context 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The flight aggregator website requires a database to store user preferences, saved destinations, and travel-related metadata. The backend must support complex and flexible querying to generate destination suggestions based on multiple criteria such as budget, destinations, and dates.

Key forces/constraints: 
> The application may require intricate queries, including multi-field queries, conditional logic, and array and nested queries.
> Backend is built using Node.js / Express, where tight integration with the database query layer is important.
> The data model may evolve as recommendation logic becomes more sophisticated.
> Queries must remain readable, maintainable, and efficient as complexity increases.
> Firebase was evaluated as an alternative due to its simplicity and ease of setup, but its querying model is more limited and optimized for simple queries. 



-----------------------------------------------------------------

Decision 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
We chose MongoDB as the primary database over Firebase. MongoDB was selected because it offers greater complexity and expressive power in queries, allowing us to support complex filtering, aggregation, and evolving data relationships. Its model aligns well with the flexible and nested structure of travel preference data. 

Firebase is simpler to use but was not chosen because it provides weaker querying capabilities, particularly for multi-criteria searches and advanced filtering logic that the application may require as it grows. 


 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Status

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Accepted.



-----------------------------------------------------------------

Consequences 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Gain: 
> Ability to perform complex, multi-criteria queries needed for flight recommendations.
> Strong support for nested documents and arrays, which we believe will match the application’s data model.
> Greater control over query optimization and indexing.
> Easier evolution of data structures if business logic becomes more advanced.
> Familiar tooling, patterns, and documentation within a Node.js backend.

Lose:  
> Increased setup and complexity compared to Firebase.
> More explicit schema and index management are required.
> Slightly higher learning curve for developers unfamiliar with MongoDB’s query language.

Remaining Risks:  
> Poorly designed queries or missing indexes could impact performance.
> Schema flexibility may lead to inconsistency if not governed by conventions or validation.
> Operational responsibility (scaling and backups) must be managed carefully if not using a fully managed service.
