ADR-001: Backend-Centric Flight Aggregation Architecture

Status: Accepted

Context

The project is a web-based flight aggregation platform that allows users to search and compare flight options across multiple sources. The system must support user authentication, flight search, and result comparison while remaining feasible for a small student team to deliver a beta version by mid-semester.

Key constraints and forces include:

Dependency on third-party or mock flight data sources with varying reliability and data formats

Limited development time and team capacity

The need for clear separation of concerns to support future changes

A requirement to demonstrate professional software engineering practices, including scalability and maintainability

The team must decide where core aggregation and comparison logic should reside.

Decision

We decided to implement a backend-centric architecture, where all flight aggregation, filtering, and comparison logic is handled by a dedicated backend API server. The frontend web application is responsible only for user interaction and presentation, while the backend communicates with external flight data sources (or mock APIs) and the user database.

Consequences
Positive Consequences

Centralizes business logic, making the system easier to test and maintain

Allows the frontend to remain simple and focused on usability

Makes it easier to replace or add flight data sources in the future

Aligns with industry-standard web application architecture patterns

Negative Consequences / Risks

Introduces additional complexity compared to a frontend-only approach

Requires API design, error handling, and backend deployment considerations

Performance depends on backend scalability and external API reliability

Overall, this decision improves long-term maintainability and scalability at the cost of slightly increased initial complexity, which the team considers acceptable given the project goals.
